Middleware, git collab practice, authentication and authorisation.



`node --watch-path=./ --watch-preserve-output ./src/index.js` is equivalent to `nodemon ./src/index.js`, and has been a stable feature since Node 20 and 22 

`node --env-file-if-exists=.env ./src/index.js` is the built-in way to process a .env file now, no need for dotenv for default usage.
